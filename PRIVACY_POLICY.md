## ImmuNB: Privacy policy

Welcome to the ImmuNB app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Mike Gerdov. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.
I have programmed this app to only collect minimal personally identifiable information needed for the app to function.
All data received from MyHealthNB portal (https://myhealth.gnb.ca/) related to you, is encrypted and stored on this device only.
It can be deleted by Resetting your Immunization Profile or simply clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

The exception to this is the data shared as the Immunization Verification barcode as part of the app functionality.
Barcode data itself is encrypted and protected against alterations. It only includes your Name, DOB (optional/configurable), and the list of COVID vaccinations (date and type).

The Barcode Verifier only sees your Name, DOB (optional/configurable), and number of vaccinations, as a proof of your full-vaccination status.
The scanned barcode data is not stored by the verifier device, and promptly discarded once confirmed.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Mike Gerdov.
