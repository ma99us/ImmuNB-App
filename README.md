# MyHealthNBLite

This is an Android app to display and securely verify personal COVID-19 immunization status. 
Currently works only for New Brunswick, Canada, and requires the user to have a valid account with https://myhealth.gnb.ca/ portal.

## This is a hobby project and in no way assosiated with MyHealthNB.
I made the best effort to protect and not disclose any personal inforamtion of the user, but I make no security claims; use this app for your own risk.
